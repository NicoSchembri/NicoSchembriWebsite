        <!-- Asynchronous Networking Library & Chat Application -->
        <div class="project">
            <h2>Asynchronous Networking Library & Chat Application</h2>
            <p><strong>University of Utah - Kahlert School of Computing</strong></p>
            <p><em>Fall 2024</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a general-purpose asynchronous networking library in C# to support text-based communication, enabling seamless client-server interactions for a chat application and future game projects.</li>
                <li>Developed a multi-threaded chat server capable of handling multiple clients concurrently, broadcasting messages to all connected users, and dynamically assigning usernames to clients upon connection.</li>
                <li>Ensured thread safety and race condition prevention by implementing proper synchronization techniques in the server and networking library.</li>
                <li>Integrated logging functionality to monitor and debug server and client activities, ensuring proper error handling and system traceability.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with a partner using pair programming and GitHub for version control, following Agile practices to deliver the project iteratively.</li>
                <li>Utilized TcpClient/TcpListener APIs to build a robust networking infrastructure, abstracting low-level details for ease of use in higher-level applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> C#, .NET, TcpClient/TcpListener, Multi-threading, Concurrency, Logging, GitHub</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Spreadsheet Application with GUI -->
        <div class="project">
            <h2>Spreadsheet Application with GUI</h2>
            <p><strong>University of Utah - Kahlert School of Computing</strong></p>
            <p><em>Fall 2024</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a fully functional spreadsheet application with a Blazor-based GUI, enabling users to input data, formulas, and perform calculations in real-time.</li>
                <li>Integrated the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to separate the spreadsheet logic (Model) from the GUI (View) and user interactions (Controller), ensuring maintainability and scalability.</li>
                <li>Developed features such as cell selection, formula evaluation, and dynamic updates for dependent cells, ensuring accurate and efficient spreadsheet functionality.</li>
                <li>Implemented file I/O operations to save and load spreadsheets in JSON format, including error handling for invalid file inputs.</li>
                <li>Added advanced features such as keyboard navigation, cell highlighting for formula dependencies, and a warning system for unsaved changes, enhancing user experience.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with a partner using pair programming and GitHub for version control, following Agile practices to deliver the project iteratively.</li>
                <li>Conducted code reviews and documented design decisions, challenges, and time tracking in the project README.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Blazor, C#, .NET, MVC Architecture, JSON, GitHub, Pair Programming</p>

        <!-- Snake Game Client Development -->
        <div class="project snake-client">
            <h2>Snake Game Client Development</h2>
            <p><strong>University of Utah - Kahlert School of Computing</strong></p>
            <p><em>Fall 2024</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a Blazor-based GUI client for a networked Snake game, enabling real-time interaction with a server to display game state and send player commands.</li>
                <li>Implemented client-server communication using a custom protocol, including JSON serialization/deserialization for game objects (snakes, walls, power-ups).</li>
                <li>Designed and structured the application using MVC architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.</li>
                <li>Utilized multi-threading and concurrency to handle real-time updates and user inputs while avoiding race conditions.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with a partner using pair programming and GitHub for version control, following Agile practices to deliver the project iteratively.</li>
                <li>Enhanced user experience by creating a visually appealing GUI with custom graphics, animations, and a heads-up display (HUD) for player stats.</li>
                <li>Debugged and optimized the client to maintain a consistent frame rate of 50+ FPS while handling server updates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Blazor, C#, .NET 8, JSON, MVC Architecture, GitHub, Multi-threading, Concurrency</p>

        <!-- Halo Energy Sword 3D Model -->
        <div class="project">
            <h2>Halo Energy Sword 3D Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Digital Arts Class</strong></p>
            <p><em>Fall 2024</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and modeled the iconic Energy Sword from the <em>Halo</em> franchise using Autodesk Maya, focusing on accuracy and attention to detail.</li>
                <li>Created the sword's hilt and energy blades using polygonal modeling techniques, ensuring clean topology and proper scaling.</li>
                <li>Applied materials and textures to replicate the metallic finish of the hilt and the glowing, translucent effect of the energy blades.</li>
                <li>Utilized emissive materials and strategic lighting to enhance the futuristic glow of the sword, rendering the final model with Arnold for a polished look.</li>
                <li>Overcame challenges in balancing realism with the game's stylized aesthetic, particularly in achieving the glowing energy effect for the blades.</li>
                <li>Demonstrated creativity and technical skill by translating a 2D game asset into a fully realized 3D model.</li>
